                    Walley Language is a script language that       
                    compiles Walley Language into Javascript which  
                    can be embeded into webpage. Parts of Walley    
                    Language needs Node.Js support.                 
                                                                                    
                       It is the language for creating a WORLD:)   


        I just started this project, so there are still lots of bugs.
